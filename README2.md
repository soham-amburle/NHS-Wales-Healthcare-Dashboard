## 📘 Overview
The **Outpatients & Elective Pathway (RTT) Dashboard** provides a detailed analysis of patient flow through **NHS Wales elective and outpatient services**.  
Built in **Power BI** using a synthetic dataset, this dashboard highlights key performance indicators including referral volumes, waiting times, treatment compliance, and pathway bottlenecks.

The dashboard helps stakeholders understand waiting list pressures, track RTT compliance (26-week standard), and monitor delays across specialties and health boards.  
Interactive filters allow users to explore the data by specialty, admission type, and time period.

## 📊 Dashboard Components

### **1. Cards (KPI Indicators)**
These KPIs provide a quick overview of RTT performance and patient load:

- **Total Referrals** – total number of outpatient and elective referrals  
- **Patients Waiting >26 Weeks** – backlog of patients exceeding 26-week RTT target  
- **Patients Waiting >52 Weeks** – patients waiting beyond 52 weeks  
- **Patients Treated** – total number of patients who have received treatment  
- **Average Waiting Days** – mean waiting time for patients in the pathway  
- **Longest Wait** – maximum waiting time recorded
