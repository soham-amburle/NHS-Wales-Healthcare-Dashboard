## 📘 Overview  
The **Population Health Dashboard** provides an interactive view of the demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics of the population served across **NHS Wales**.  
Developed in **Power BI** using a synthetic dataset, it highlights key measures such as age distribution, comorbidity burden, smoking prevalence, deprivation levels, sex distribution, and flu vaccination uptake—supporting population health management, service planning, and public health interventions.

## 📊 Dashboard Components

### 1. Slicers (Interactive Filters)  
Interactive slicers allow users to filter the population for targeted analysis:

- **WIMD Quintile** – compare health characteristics and outcomes across socioeconomic deprivation levels.  
- **Sex** – view population differences between male, female, or other gender categories.  
- **Local Health Board** – isolate data by NHS Wales regional health boards.  
- **Vaccination Uptake** – focus on vaccinated or unvaccinated population cohorts.

### 2. KPI Cards  
High-level indicators providing quick insight into public health coverage:

- **Flu Vaccine Uptake (%)** – percentage of the population who received the seasonal flu vaccine.

---

### 3. Age Band Distribution (Clustered Column Chart)  
Visualizes the population size across predefined age groups, highlighting high-demand cohorts such as children, adults, or older adults.

---

### 4. Comorbidity Count (Clustered Column Chart)  
Shows the distribution of patients by the number of chronic conditions, illustrating clinical complexity and areas with higher healthcare needs.

### 5. Deprivation (WIMD Quintile) Distribution (Clustered Column Chart)  
Displays the population across deprivation levels, supporting analysis of health inequalities and socioeconomic influences on health outcomes.

---

### 6. Smoking Status (Clustered Column Chart)  
Illustrates prevalence of smoking among the population, identifying lifestyle risk factors contributing to chronic disease.

---

### 7. Sex Distribution (Donut Chart)  
Provides a quick visual of gender composition within the population, supporting demographic segmentation and comparative analyses.
